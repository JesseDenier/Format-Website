## Installation

Gain access to ftp.formatllc.com (Transmit is a good tool for this).

Navigate to the "public_html" directory.

Backup and delete all files associated with the website, leaving the following unrelated folders.

- cgi-bin: A standard web server directory folder that stores scripts and programs that can be executed to generate dynamic content (currently unused).
- citf: A file transfer system we have been using with CITF for decades.
- ISCA: Standard pdf documents that may be being accessed through ISCA book links.
- publicFTP: A currently empty folder that could be used similar to "citf."
- x_2019_site: A preserved backup of the 2019 website file structure.
- x_2024_site: A preserved backup of the 2024 website file structure.

Place all files contained within this repository excluding ".gitignore" in the "public_html" folder of the Format FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
